ARGUS-X
Evidence-Driven Security Telemetry Correlation & Attack Reconstruction

Connect the evidence. Reconstruct the attack.

ARGUS-X is a security investigation platform that transforms fragmented telemetry from authentication, endpoint, network, and application sources into a transparent, evidence-backed attack narrative.

Instead of asking only “Is this event suspicious?”, ARGUS-X asks:

What happened?
Which events belong to the same attack?
Why do we believe they are connected?
What evidence is missing?
What was affected?
What could have been prevented?
Problem

Modern cyberattacks leave evidence across multiple telemetry sources. Authentication logs may show suspicious access, endpoint logs may show execution or credential access, network logs may show lateral movement, and application logs may show access to critical assets.

Because these sources are fragmented, analysts must manually correlate events, reconstruct the attack sequence, determine the strength of evidence, and identify gaps.

ARGUS-X addresses this investigation problem by correlating heterogeneous telemetry and reconstructing a coherent attack narrative.

Investigation & Recommendations

The system does not simply classify every suspicious-looking event as malicious. Events are evaluated based on entity relationships, temporal continuity, and attack-stage progression before becoming part of the reconstructed attack path.

What Makes ARGUS-X Different?
1. Evidence-Driven Reconstruction

ARGUS-X builds attack narratives from traceable telemetry evidence rather than presenting isolated alerts.

2. Confidence ≠ Completeness

ARGUS-X separates:

Confidence: How strongly is the reconstructed conclusion supported by available evidence?

Completeness: How much of the expected attack sequence is observable?

This allows the system to represent strong evidence even when parts of an attack remain unobservable.

3. Evidence-Gap Intelligence

When available telemetry cannot sufficiently support part of an investigation, ARGUS-X identifies the evidence gap and recommends additional telemetry that could reduce the uncertainty.

4. Explainable Correlation

The system provides the reasoning behind event relationships instead of treating correlation as a black box.

5. Grounded Investigation AI

The AI Investigator works from the reconstructed investigation context and supporting evidence. The AI layer assists analysts with investigation and explanation rather than acting as the primary detection engine.

6. Counterfactual Analysis

Analysts can ask what would happen if a particular attack stage had been blocked and examine downstream stages that could have been prevented according to the reconstructed dependency chain.

Correlation Approach

ARGUS-X uses a deterministic, rule-based correlation approach.

Events receive correlation strength based on contextual relationships:

Same User              +1
Same Source Host       +3
Same Destination Host  +2
Within 60 seconds      +1

A correlation score of 3 or higher is considered correlated.

Conceptually:

C(ei, ej) =
    User Match
  + Source Host Match
  + Destination Host Match
  + Temporal Proximity

Correlation is only one stage of the process. The reconstruction engine additionally considers temporal ordering and attack-stage progression to determine whether correlated events form a coherent attack path.

Evidence Model

ARGUS-X categorizes evidence into three states:

Status	Meaning
Verified	Directly supported by available telemetry
Inferred	Supported by multiple related signals but not directly observed
Unsupported	Insufficient evidence to establish the conclusion

An unknown or missing signal is not automatically treated as false.

This allows ARGUS-X to explicitly represent uncertainty instead of hiding it.

Demonstration Dataset

The working prototype uses a synthetic heterogeneous security telemetry dataset containing 809 events.

Source	Events
Authentication	232
Endpoint	223
Network	203
Application	151
Total	809

The dataset contains both attack-related activity and legitimate background noise.

ARGUS-X processes the complete telemetry set and reconstructs the coherent attack path rather than receiving only pre-selected attack events.

Demonstration Attack Path
PC-25
  ↓
SRV-02
  ↓
DB-01

The demonstrated reconstruction contains 8 coherent attack events, covering stages from initial access through database access.

Example Investigation

In the demonstration scenario, ARGUS-X reconstructs activity involving:

Authentication
      ↓
Process Execution
      ↓
Credential Access
      ↓
Lateral Movement
      ↓
Privilege Escalation
      ↓
Database Connection
      ↓
Database Access

The platform then provides:

Attack timeline
Attack graph
Evidence relationships
Confidence and completeness
Evidence gaps
Infrastructure map
Blast radius
Counterfactual analysis
Attack replay
AI-assisted investigation
Blast Radius

The Attack Graph answers:

How did the attack move?

The Blast Radius answers:

What was affected?

For the demonstration scenario:

PC-25 → SRV-02 → DB-01

ARGUS-X identifies:

Affected hosts
Compromised user
Critical asset
Attack origin
Compromised pivot
Final critical asset
Counterfactual Analysis

ARGUS-X supports hypothetical attack analysis.

Example:

What if lateral movement had been blocked?

The system evaluates the reconstructed dependency chain and identifies downstream stages that would have been prevented according to that hypothetical condition.

This helps analysts reason about potential prevention points rather than only explaining what already happened.

AI Investigator

The AI Investigator provides evidence-grounded answers to analyst questions.

Example:

Question:
How did the attacker reach DB-01?

Context:
Reconstructed attack timeline
Attack graph
Supporting evidence
Infrastructure relationships

The AI response is generated from the investigation evidence and is intended to distinguish supported conclusions from unsupported claims.

The core security analysis remains deterministic. The AI layer is used for investigation assistance and explanation.

Tailwind CSS
FastAPI
Pydantic
Pandas
NetworkX
MITRE ATT&CK
OpenAI API

The demonstration dataset is synthetic security telemetry created for the project.

Research & References

The project was informed by research and security frameworks including:

MITRE ATT&CK
NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3
SLEUTH: Attack Scenario Reconstruction
Tactical Provenance Analysis
Microsoft Sentinel
Elastic Security

These resources provide research, security-framework, and industry context for the project.

Limitations

ARGUS-X is a hackathon prototype and currently uses deterministic, rule-based correlation and reconstruction logic.

Current limitations include:

Correlation rules are predefined.
Reconstruction coverage depends on represented telemetry patterns.
Real-world deployments would require additional telemetry parsers and attack patterns.
Larger datasets and broader attack scenarios would be required for production-scale evaluation.
Missing telemetry can make portions of an attack unobservable.

The system explicitly exposes evidence gaps rather than assuming missing information.

Future Scope

Potential future improvements include:

Additional telemetry formats such as Syslog and JSON
Broader endpoint and network telemetry coverage
Adaptive correlation
Larger attack-scenario evaluation datasets
More comprehensive MITRE ATT&CK mapping
Scalable distributed event processing
Advanced entity resolution
Automated incident reporting
Additional prevention and response integrations
